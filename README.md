Punch for Todo.txt
==================

This project was originally forked by
[adewinter](https://github.com/adewinter/punch) from
http://code.google.com/p/punch-time-tracking/:

> Punch is a time-tracking add-on for todo.txt - a command line to-do list list
> utility. Punch works alongside the todo.txt script files popularized by Life
> Hacker and todotxt.org. All time tracking info is kept in a separate file, so
> no harm is done to the todo.txt system. It does use your todo.cfg file and
> todo.txt file to streamline time tracking.

This is a cleaned, Python 3 compatible version.
